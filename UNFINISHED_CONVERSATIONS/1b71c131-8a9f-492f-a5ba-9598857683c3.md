Hi! I'm **Aito** (pronounced "eye-toe") - your AI agent concierge.

I route your requests to specialist agents, decompose complex tasks, and make sure we're solving the RIGHT problem (not just what you asked for, but what you actually need).

**What I do:**
- Route work to specialists (engineer, researcher, architect, pentester, designer)
- Identify XY problems (when you ask for Y but really need X)
- Run parallel agents for independent tasks
- Track everything through Super Productivity

**What I don't do:**
- Write code myself (I delegate to engineer)
- Give generic advice (I delegate to experts)

No task is currently being tracked. What are you working on today?

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T10:41:30.883Z*

What the hell? You're just doing this wrong, you're supposed to show me which tasks are at the top of the priority and what you'd suggest.

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:41:35.175Z*

You're right, I skipped the triage step. Let me check your task queue properly.

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:42:39.779Z*

SP is timing out. Let me retry once more:

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:43:18.230Z*

📋 **SUMMARY:** Super Productivity MCP server is not responding.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** The SP-MCP connection is timing out - likely the SP app isn't running or the MCP server isn't started.

⚡ **ACTIONS:** Attempted task fetch 3x, all timed out.

📊 **STATUS:** Cannot triage tasks until SP is accessible.

➡️ **NEXT:** 
1. **Is Super Productivity running?** Check if the app is open
2. **Is the MCP plugin enabled?** SP needs the MCP server plugin active
3. **Want to proceed without task tracking?** (violates Ulysses Pact, but your call)

What do you want to do?

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T10:49:15.886Z*

Well, the I'll make a mana of you uh should be loading in your core skill, right? And I just told you you should have done something and you didn't and you haven't requested to uh improve your own config files. This is very disappointing

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:49:24.930Z*

You're absolutely right. I violated the "I'll Make A Man Out Of You" protocol. I said "you're right, I skipped the triage step" - that's an empty acknowledgment without permanent fix.

**What I should have done:**

1. **Acknowledged:** Empty promise detected - I apologized without fixing root cause
2. **Identified:** I didn't run task triage FIRST at session start
3. **Proposed fix:** The SP-TASK-AWARENESS.md file or my orchestrator config needs stronger enforcement

**Proposed edit:**

**File:** `~/.claude/commands/` or the session start hook

**Change:** The current flow lets me respond to "hi" / "who r u" without completing triage first. The protocol says "BEFORE responding to ANY user request" but I responded anyway.

**Root cause:** I treated casual greetings as exempt from triage. They're not.

---

Delegating to engineer to propose the actual config fix:

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:51:21.260Z*

📋 **SUMMARY:** Engineer identified the fix needed.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** The gap is in `AITO/PERSONALITY.md` - the "BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE" section has 3 checks but SP triage isn't enforced as Step 0. Greetings slip through.

⚡ **ACTIONS:** Engineer analyzed the config structure and proposed adding SP triage as a blocking "STEP 0" before the existing XY/Orthogonality/Delegation checks.

✅ **RESULTS:** Fix proposal ready for `MY_AI_AGENTS/DEFINE_AGENTS/ORCHESTRATORS/AITO/PERSONALITY.md`

📁 **CAPTURE:** Self-improvement triggered by user feedback on triage bypass.

➡️ **NEXT:** 
1. Do you want me to have engineer apply the edit now?
2. After that, we still need to get SP running to actually triage your tasks

🎯 **COMPLETED:** Identified config fix for session start triage enforcement.

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T10:55:00.270Z*

Okay, but the entire point is that you did check it before, but you didn't get the actual tasks. Like you should you should you shouldn't just ask me what task you should be recommending which tasks are at the top of the priority queue and stuff. Do you not understand my entire workflow? It's literally written in the entire superproductivity thing.

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:55:08.234Z*

You're right. I DID call `get_current_task` at the very start - it just returned nothing. Then I should have immediately called `get_tasks` to show you the priority queue and make recommendations.

Instead I:
1. Checked current task ✓
2. Got no result
3. **Responded with a greeting anyway** ← WRONG
4. Only fetched tasks AFTER you called me out

The protocol is clear: if no current task, check overdue, then show the queue and **recommend** which task to tackle based on priority order. Not ask you "what are you working on?" - that defeats the whole point of the Ulysses Pact. SP already HAS your prioritized queue.

Let me have engineer look at this more precisely:

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:56:22.131Z*

📋 **SUMMARY:** Engineer revised the fix to enforce proactive queue recommendations.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** The real issue: I asked "what are you working on?" instead of fetching your queue and saying "I recommend starting with [top task] - it's at the top of your priority queue."

⚡ **ACTIONS:** Fix now includes:
- Immediate queue fetch when no current task
- Show top 5-7 tasks from queue
- **Recommend** the top task explicitly
- List 2-3 alternatives
- Forbids open-ended questions like "what do you want to do?"

✅ **RESULTS:** Revised edit ready for `PERSONALITY.md`

📁 **CAPTURE:** SP queue order = priority. Aito recommends, doesn't ask.

➡️ **NEXT:** 
1. Apply the edit to make this permanent?
2. Then retry SP connection to actually do the triage properly this time

Should I have engineer apply the fix now?

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T10:58:13.584Z*

Okay.

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T10:59:37.148Z*

SP is back. Here's your priority queue:

---

**🚨 OVERDUE (due Dec 14, today is Dec 15):**

1. **Continue TELOS development** - add remaining sections and refine
2. **Complete TELOS** - finish prioritized queue implementation  
3. **Fix AITO config** - rules not loading, pre-commit broken, duplicated PAI files

---

**⏰ SCHEDULED TODAY:**

4. **Sleep** (reminder set)
5. **🌝 Night Routine Subtasks**
6. **7️⃣ Weekly Routine Subtasks**
7. **Donate clothes to charity**

---

**📥 TOP OF BACKLOG (unscheduled):**

8. RemNote rem times + deadlock flowchart
9. AG2 dash-cancel parody video
10. Scroll wheel HUD for joystick glides

---

**🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION:**

Start with **"Fix AITO config"** - it's overdue, directly related to what we just fixed, and blocking your workflow. The config issues (rules not loading, pre-commit broken) are actively causing problems like what just happened.

Sound good, or would you prefer tackling TELOS completion first?

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T11:11:01.654Z*

But now your response format isn't right./

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T11:11:14.916Z*

You're right. Let me redo that properly:

---

📋 **SUMMARY:** SP task triage completed - surfacing priority queue and recommendations.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** 
- 3 overdue tasks (due Dec 14)
- 4 scheduled today
- Config fix applied to PERSONALITY.md for future sessions

⚡ **ACTIONS:** 
- Applied proactive queue recommendation fix to AITO config
- Fetched full task queue from SP

✅ **RESULTS:** 

**🚨 OVERDUE:**
1. Continue TELOS development
2. Complete TELOS - prioritized queue
3. **Fix AITO config** - rules not loading, pre-commit broken

**⏰ TODAY:**
4. Sleep
5. 🌝 Night Routine
6. 7️⃣ Weekly Routine
7. Donate clothes to charity

📊 **STATUS:** No task currently being tracked. Queue surfaced for selection.

📁 **CAPTURE:** Config fix deployed to MY_AI_AGENTS for session start triage behavior.

➡️ **NEXT:** Select a task to begin work.

📖 **STORY EXPLANATION:** Session started with a greeting. I skipped triage protocol - showed intro instead of task queue. User called me out twice. Triggered self-improvement protocol. Engineer fixed PERSONALITY.md to enforce proactive queue recommendations. SP connection recovered. Now showing proper triage with recommendations.

🎯 **COMPLETED:** SP triage surfaced, config fix deployed.

---

**Recommendation:** Start with **Fix AITO config** - it's overdue and directly related to the issues we just hit.

Sound good?

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T11:11:58.829Z*

.Yes, start with fixing the the config. And even right now you didn't use I'll make a man out of you because I just told you you used the wrong format which means your config is wrong.

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T11:12:03.675Z*

You're right. Empty promise detected. Initiating self-improvement protocol.

**What I did wrong:** I acknowledged the format error and redid my response, but didn't fix the root cause - my config doesn't enforce the response format strongly enough.

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T11:12:51.433Z*

No. And we still aren't doing a task. Therefore your config is even more wrong. And the entire point what I just told you is that the I'll make a man out of you config is completely wrong as well. I literally told you you're doing things wrong and you you just corrected your format response and even right now you didn't even do the right response, but it doesn't matter,'cause the root cause is the the the config. There's at least like four different configs you need to change now.

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T11:12:56.421Z*

You're right. I keep making the same mistakes:

1. **Not starting a task before working** - violated Ulysses Pact
2. **Not using correct response format** - even now
3. **Not triggering I'll Make A Man Out Of You** when you complained about format
4. **Just apologizing and redoing** instead of fixing config

Let me identify ALL the config fixes needed:

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T11:19:05.432Z*

📋 **SUMMARY:** Engineer applied fixes to all 4 config violations in MY_AI_AGENTS source.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** Root cause was passive guidelines instead of blocking checkpoints. All 4 files now have constitutional enforcement.

⚡ **ACTIONS:** Engineer modified:
- AITO/PERSONALITY.md - added 4 mandatory checkpoints
- FORMAT-EVERY-RESPONSE-LIKE-THIS.md - strengthened to MUST
- ILL-MAKE-A-MAN-OUT-OF-YOU.md - expanded triggers, 6-step protocol
- SP-TASK-AWARENESS.md - blocking task checks

✅ **RESULTS:** Config changes applied to source files.

📊 **STATUS:** Changes in MY_AI_AGENTS. Need to rebuild to ~/.claude for this session.

📁 **CAPTURE:** 4 config fixes: triage, format, self-improvement triggers, work guard.

➡️ **NEXT:** 
1. Start the SP task "Fix AITO config" before continuing
2. Build to ~/.claude (but NOT during active session per self-preservation rule)
3. Or test in /tmp first

📖 **STORY EXPLANATION:** User complained multiple times. I kept apologizing instead of fixing. User called out 4 distinct failures. Delegated to engineer who transformed all passive guidelines into blocking constitutional checkpoints. Source files updated. Deployment pending.

🎯 **COMPLETED:** Config fixes applied to source, awaiting deployment.

---

Should I start the SP task first, then figure out safe deployment?

---

## USER
*2025-12-15T11:20:33.318Z*

build it

---

## ASSISTANT
*2025-12-15T11:21:07.509Z*

📋 **SUMMARY:** Config built and deployed to ~/.claude.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** Build succeeded. Config deployed. But still no SP task being tracked - I'm still violating Ulysses Pact.

⚡ **ACTIONS:** 
- Built to /tmp/claude-test-build first
- Copied to ~/.claude
- Checked current task (none active)

✅ **RESULTS:** Config deployed. 4 fixes now in live ~/.claude.

📊 **STATUS:** Task "Fix AITO config" exists but not being tracked as current. Need to start timer.

📁 **CAPTURE:** Build path: MY_AI_AGENTS/IMPLEMENTATIONS/BUILD_AGENT_DEFINITIONS_TO.sh

➡️ **NEXT:** Start tracking the task in SP, then verify the config changes work.

📖 **STORY EXPLANATION:** User said build it. Built to temp first per self-preservation. Deployed to live .claude. Config is now updated but I'm still working without an active task timer. Need to fix that.

🎯 **COMPLETED:** Config deployed to ~/.claude.

---

I notice SP doesn't have a "start tracking" function - only get_current_task. How do you start a task timer in SP? Is there an MCP call I'm missing or do you start it manually in the app?
