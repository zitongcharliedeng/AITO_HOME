No active task is being tracked. Let me check for overdue and queued tasks.

🚨 **TASK TRIAGE REQUIRED** 🚨

You have **2 overdue tasks** (due 2025-12-14):
1. **Continue TELOS development** - add remaining sections and refine
2. **Complete TELOS** - finish prioritized queue implementation

Which should we tackle first? Or would you prefer to work on something else?

## 📚 What is Vitest?

**Vitest** is a blazing-fast unit testing framework for JavaScript/TypeScript, built natively on **Vite**.

**Key features:**
- **Vite-native** - uses Vite's transform pipeline, so your tests share the same config as your app
- **Jest-compatible API** - drop-in replacement for most Jest tests (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, etc.)
- **ESM-first** - native ES modules support out of the box
- **TypeScript support** - works with TS without extra config
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** - tests re-run instantly on file changes
- **Built-in coverage** - via c8/istanbul
- **Snapshot testing** - like Jest
- **In-source testing** - can write tests alongside your code

**Why use Vitest over Jest?**
- Significantly faster (especially in watch mode)
- No duplicate config if you already use Vite
- Better ESM support
- Modern architecture

**Basic example:**
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'

describe('math', () => {
  it('adds numbers', () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toBe(2)
  })
})
```

s character name in Vim

---

## ASSISTANT

The **`s`** command in Vim stands for **"substitute"** (sometimes called "change character").

**What it does:**
- Deletes the character under the cursor
- Puts you in Insert mode to type a replacement

**Think of it as:** `cl` (change + move right) — delete one character and start inserting.

**Related commands:**
| Command | Name | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| `s` | substitute | Delete char, enter Insert mode |
| `S` | substitute line | Delete entire line, enter Insert mode |
| `c` | change | Change (with motion) |
| `x` | delete char | Delete char, stay in Normal mode |

**Example:**
If cursor is on `h` in `hello`:
- Press `s` → `h` deleted, now in Insert mode
- Type `j` → result is `jello`
